# GIMP - crop and resize

See [this youtube videp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rGGpOTSpbc&index=3&list=PLC5B3750CE8219376) by GIMPTRICKS.

Lesson learnt:

- use the crop tool to crop image.
- use duplicate layer to make a hard copy of a layer (so we get to do cropping and resizing manytimes).
- on a layer, to resize, to to image -> scale image. Ensure width and height are linked (to lock aspect ratio). Use pecentage to scale. Use cubic.
- To export only one layer, just make only the final layer visible (click the eye in the layer.)
